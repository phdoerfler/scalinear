# Scalinear
Scalinear is a basic vector and matrix library for Scala.

I built this library in response to a gap I encountered when working with OpenGL--there seems to be no simple matrix implementation readily used with Scala.

If you need a robust solution, please see [Breeze](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze).
